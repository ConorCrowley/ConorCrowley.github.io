            <p1>For our first scratch game, we created a basic platform runner. We spent most of out time working on the controls and game mechanics. We coded gravity using velocity variable and acceleration/deceleration using a horizontal velocity variable. To make our sprite look more dynamic in its movement, we created different costume for when it was running, jumping, and falling, and coded it so it would switch to that costume when it was running, jumping, or falling in a particular direction. We also coded lives so if you touched the enemy three times the backdrop would switch to a game over screen and stop the game.</p1>

            <p1>We created a semester GPA calculator for our MIT App Inventor project. We programmed two screens, one in which we would input our grades and class info, and a second which would output our GPA and a funny picture or college reccommendation. In the first screen, you select your grade and whether or not the class was A.P. from a drop down menu in a table of classes. After you pick grade it changes the text of the list picker to match your answer so you're able to conform put the right information in. After you click "calculate" it directs you to another screen which displays your calculated GPA. We were inspired by Roger Hub's final grade calculator which includes words of advice depending on the grade you need on your final to get an A in the class. For our app, we decided to include a funny picture or college recommendation. The color of the second screen also changed depending on your gpa. A bright green for a good GPA, and a dark red for a bad GPA.</p1>
