            <p1>For our first scratch game, we created a basic platform runner. We spent most of out time working on the controls and game mechanics. We coded gravity using velocity variable and acceleration/deceleration using a horizontal velocity variable. To make our sprite look more dynamic in its movement, we created different costume for when it was running, jumping, and falling, and coded it so it would switch to that costume when it was running, jumping, or falling in a particular direction. We also coded lives so if you touched the enemy three times the backdrop would switch to a game over screen and stop the game</p1>
